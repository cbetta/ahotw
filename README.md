#A History of the world in 100 objects - Mobile Edition

A simple prototype built during History Hackday London 2011 to show how the History of the World in 100 objects data could be made more accessible for mobile.

It uses jQuery mobile and it scrapes data from the BBC, Wikipedia, and the British Museum.

## Demo

I've had to take the demo offline as it wasn't working as it should anymore. I don't do PHP/Symfony anymore so it will take a while to maybe rewrite this to a rails/static app.
