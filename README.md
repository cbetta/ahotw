#A History of the world in 100 objects - Mobile Edition

A simple prototype built during History Hackday London 2011 to show how the [History of the World in 100 objects](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/) data could be made more accessible for mobile.

It uses jQuery mobile and it scrapes data from the BBC, Wikipedia, and the British Museum.
